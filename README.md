About BioFood Factory:

Bio-food Factory is a food automation game where you can sell mutated food to customers and complete contracts to earn profit for the company.

You can build Ingredients extractors, set up cutters and cookers, and package the completed products to sell and fulfil contracts. All before the bill catches up and bankrupts your factory.

Produce Ingredients:

Place extractors on their respective tiles and produce raw ingredients to supply your factory. These remote lands means we can have all the ingredients we will ever need, for the next 5 years.



Process and Mutate Food:

Cut, Cook and mutate your food with our state of art food processors to further draw out their flavor (and profit).



Package Meals:

Package all the process ingredients into neatly packed Package Meals with our EZ Pizza, Soup and Burger Makers.



Complete Contracts:

Earn cash reward from contracts by fulfilling their requests. The more and harder contracts you complete, the more well-known your factory becomes. Earning enough fame to complete the level.



Power your factory:

All Machines requires power to run, and you must set up your own power supply for your remote factory. Why, it's a small cost for access to a untapped supply of ingredients.



Don't go Bankrupt:

A small cost, if you can keep up the pollution bill that is. The company has always been at odds with the National Environment Regulation Department (NERD) with our innovative remote power solution, and after a lot of compromise, bribery has been the most effective.
